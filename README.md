# DataDive_5
<h3> This data dive I used python to gain a further insight on what gives a country a high Human Development Index.

<h3> I used data visualization techniques through matploltlib to visiualize the impact that factors such as years of schooling, country happiness, and social support on the Human Development Index.
  
<h3> I also wanted to visualize how wide spread religion is across each continent. I successfully used the package circlify which uses a circle packing technique to show the difference in volume of each religion.
